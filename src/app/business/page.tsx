            If your business requires regularly produced 3D printed products,
            you may be in luck.
            <br />
            We already have several clients that can vouch for our reliability and the quality of our product.
            <br />
            A benefit of working with a local 3D printing service is that overseas
            shipping times and costs arent a factor to overcome, simply wait for us to
            drive over from Ewa at a schedule of your preference.
            <br />
            <br />
            Please reach out at
            the following email if youâ€™d like more information including,
            but not limited to, our wholesale prices.
