            If your business requires regularly produced 3D printed products,
            you may be in luck. We already have several clients that can vouch
            for our reliability and the quality of our product.
            A benefit of working with a local 3D printing service is that oversea
            shipping times and costs arent a factor to overcome, simply wait for us to
            drive over from Ewa at a schedule of your preference. Please reach out at
            the following email if youâ€™d like more information includin,
            but not limited to, our wholesale prices.
